# terraform-aws-oidc-core

A reusable Terraform module that provisions and configures an **AWS OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider** for use with **GitHub Actions** and other trusted OIDC-based CI/CD workflows.

This module simplifies and standardizes the setup of AWS‚ÄìGitHub OIDC trust, enabling **secure, keyless authentication** for CI/CD pipelines ‚Äî without the need to store or rotate long-lived AWS credentials.

---

## üìò Overview

Modern CI/CD workflows demand **secure and temporary authentication methods** that minimize credential exposure.
`terraform-aws-oidc-core` provides a **centralized and consistent implementation** of the AWS OIDC provider configuration that can be reused across multiple repositories and environments.

By defining the OIDC provider once, teams can:

* Improve **security** by eliminating static AWS access keys.
* Increase **consistency** across projects using a shared Terraform module.
* Simplify **management** and **auditing** of OIDC trust relationships.

---

## üöÄ Features

* Creates an **AWS IAM OIDC provider** for GitHub Actions.
* Accepts **custom OIDC URLs** and **thumbprint lists** for flexibility.
* Designed to be **referenced by multiple AWS accounts or projects**.
* Compatible with **cross-account role assumptions** using GitHub OIDC tokens.
* Provides a **foundation module** for higher-level Terraform projects.

---

## üß© Usage Example

```hcl
module "oidc_core" {
  source = "github.com/your-org/terraform-aws-oidc-core"

  github_oidc_url          = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
  github_oidc_thumbprints  = ["6938fd4d98bab03faadb97b34396831e3780aea1"]
}
```

This will create an **AWS OIDC identity provider** trusted by GitHub Actions.
You can then reference this OIDC provider in other Terraform modules to create IAM roles that trust GitHub repositories or organizations.

## üîí Why This Module Matters

This repository serves as a **core infrastructure component** for all future automation and CI/CD-related AWS projects within your organization.

### Key Benefits:

* **Centralized Trust:** Defines a single source of truth for OIDC integration, ensuring consistent configuration across all projects.
* **Scalability:** New repositories can onboard quickly without repeating provider setup.
* **Security by Design:** Encourages secure, temporary credentials aligned with AWS best practices.
* **Reduced Maintenance:** Eliminates the need to manage static credentials or replicate OIDC setups in multiple repos.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Future Use Cases

* Integration with `terraform-aws-github-ci-role` modules to assign repository-specific IAM roles.
* Expansion to support other OIDC providers (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket, or custom IdPs).
* Shared module for multi-account setups and cross-organization OIDC federation.
